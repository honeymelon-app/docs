# Changelog

All notable changes to Honeymelon are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed

- macOS close (red button) and quit (Cmd+Q) now respond reliably by adding Rust-side fallbacks for window close and app exit

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- Multi-language support for window and quit confirmation dialogs (EN/ES/FR/DE/RU)
- Dock badge showing active job count when window is hidden
- System notifications when window is hidden with jobs running in background
- Dynamic dock badge updates as jobs complete or new ones are queued

### Changed

- Window close button now hides window instead of quitting app (standard macOS behavior)
- App continues running in background when window is closed with active jobs
- Quit confirmation (Cmd+Q) now properly warns about running/queued jobs before exiting
- Menu items "Show All" and "Bring All to Front" now restore hidden window

### Fixed

- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+C, Cmd+V, Cmd+A, etc.) now work in all dialogs including license activation
- Edit menu now uses native predefined items that properly integrate with webview
- Event emissions now log errors instead of silently failing
- Window focus failures are now logged for debugging

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-30

### Added

- Expanded FFmpeg pipeline coverage with additional test media formats and representative conversion outputs.
- Added planner/runner contract tests for output paths and filename collision handling.
- Added capability regression tests for missing encoders and formats.

### Changed

- Refined DMG installer layout with a custom background and adjusted icon placement.

### Fixed

- Ensured BMP/TIFF image conversions use an FFmpeg-compatible output format mapping.

## [0.0.7] - 2025-12-26

### Added

- Enforced major-version licensing: licenses now validate the running app’s major version (with lifetime licenses represented as `255` for all majors)
- Reinstall-friendly activation: stable device ID per machine + idempotent re-activation on the same device

### Fixed

- Prevented “burning” one-time activation on ineligible licenses by validating locally before calling the activation API

## [0.0.6] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed

- Improved license activation error handling: response parsing now falls back to `message` field when `error` is absent, and provides clearer parse failure messages

## [0.0.5] - 2025-12-06

### Added

- Expanded localization coverage across uploader prompts, queue controls, destination chooser, and job item actions for all supported languages (EN/ES/FR/DE/RU)
- Added i18n fallback locale and normalized locale handling to keep UI strings consistent

### Fixed

- Language selection now persists reliably across sessions with normalization of stored locales
- Main window close button now falls back to closing the window if the process plugin exit call fails, preventing no-op close attempts

## [0.0.4] - 2025-12-05

### Added

- Persist user settings and job history via the Tauri store (preferences, color mode, language, jobs), including automatic initialization of saved state on startup
- Show richer job metadata in the queue (size, duration, resolution, codecs) by probing files in the background as they are enqueued
- Indicate batch processing and block manual starts while auto-start is running to avoid double-starting queued jobs
- Constrain recursive media discovery with allowed extensions plus depth and file-count limits to prevent runaway scans

### Changed

- Hardened Tauri security: production devtools disabled, CSP enabled, asset scope narrowed, and devtools menu kept behind debug builds with capability permissions trimmed
- Refreshed job queue UI with a clearer empty state, inline actions (Finder/open, copy path, cancel/remove), and refined card layout with metadata chips
- Use locally bundled Inter font via `@fontsource` for consistent typography without external font fetches

### Fixed

- On reopen, interrupted running/probing jobs are restored as failed instead of getting stuck, preventing phantom in-progress entries

## [0.0.3] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed output file validation checking wrong path (directory instead of temp file)
  - Conversions were succeeding but reporting "something went wrong"
  - Output files were left as `.tmp` files instead of being renamed to final destination
  - Root cause: `validate_output()` was called with `final_path.parent()` instead of `temp_path`

## [0.0.2] - 2025-12-02

### Added

- FFmpeg pipeline integration test suite with 16 regression tests
- Test media generation script (`npm run generate-test-media`) for CI
- CI enforcement: tests now fail (instead of skip) when dependencies are missing in CI environment
- Expanded format support (ported from Comet):
  - Video containers: AVI, FLV, M4V, TS, OGV, MPEG (now 11 total)
  - Audio containers: OGG, AAC, AIFF, Opus (now 8 total)
  - Image containers: BMP, TIFF (now 5 total)
  - Video codecs: VP8, Theora, MPEG-4, FLV1, MPEG-2
  - Audio codecs: MP2, AC3, PCM (24-bit)
- New container compatibility rules for all added formats
- Encoder strategies for legacy codecs (Theora, MPEG-2, FLV1)
- UI animations for better user experience:
  - Theme switcher: horizontal flip on hover
  - Language switcher (globe): spin animation on hover
  - Destination folder: folder-open tilt on hover
  - Job queue items: entrance animations and hover effects
  - Progress bar: shimmer effect during conversion
  - Status badges: pulse for completed, shake for failed

### Changed

- Removed all emojis and Unicode symbols from codebase for better cross-platform compatibility
- Replaced arrows and checkmarks with ASCII equivalents (>, <>, [OK], [PASS], [FAIL])
- Removed footer from app shell, integrated controls into job queue toolbar
- Toolbar now uses icon buttons with tooltips instead of text buttons
- Updated presets system with dynamic generation from target profiles
- Container rules refactored with comprehensive codec compatibility matrix

### Fixed

- Fixed Clippy dead code warnings in FFmpeg pipeline test file
- Fixed CI pipeline tests that were silently skipping instead of failing

### Documentation

- Updated supported formats documentation with all 24 containers
- Added detailed codec compatibility matrices for each container
- Updated README with accurate format lists and line counts
- Synced VitePress docs with expanded format support
- Added FFMPEG_PIPELINE_TESTS.md documenting test infrastructure

## [0.0.1] - 2025-11-11

This is the initial public release. See [Unreleased] section for complete feature list.

### Changed

- Rust backend now loads `.env` at build time and forwards `LICENSE_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY` to the compiler for license verification (via `build.rs` and `dotenvy`).
- Added `dotenvy` to Rust build dependencies.
- Improved license key verification: key available at both build and runtime; temporary test for key loading added and removed after verification.
- Replaced all dynamic imports of Tauri API modules with static imports in frontend files to resolve Vite warnings:
  - `src/stores/license.ts`
  - `src/composables/use-file-handler.ts`
  - `src/composables/use-job-orchestrator.ts`
  - `src/lib/file-discovery.ts`
  - `src/components/DestinationChooser.vue`
- Added and improved docblocks and comments in Rust modules for clarity and maintainability (`lib.rs`, `license.rs`, `ffmpeg_capabilities.rs`).
- Embedded custom macOS `Info.plist` overrides to require native arm64 execution, enforce Retina support, and predeclare camera/microphone usage descriptions for notarization.
- Limited bundling to DMG artifacts to avoid redundant `.app` archives on Apple Silicon builds.
